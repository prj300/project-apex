# Project Apex

Project Apex is an Android app developed in Java aimed at unifying two trending activites in Ireland - cycling and the Wild Atlantic Way. 

This app intelligently finds routes based on the desires of a cyclist. Some features include;
  - Creating and saving a new route.
  - Viewing previously saved results/routes.
  - Finding routes on the Wild Atlantic Way.
  - Notifications of "pit-stops" in the path of the user.

## Finding routes on the Wild Atlantic Way

#### Finding a route by distance

Cyclists can find and embark on a route on the Wild Atlantic Way based on an input distance. A list of suitable routes' information are returned to the user and when a route is selected its waypoints are downloaded and stored on the device.

#### Finding a route by location

If this option is selected, the user will be prompted to enter a range in kilometres. A list of the most relevant routes within the selected range from the device's current location will be returned.

#### Finding a route by difficulty

The app will find and retrieve a selection of routes that match the user's cycling capabilities. The user can enter their skill level (beginner, amateur, leisure, semi-pro, professional).

#### Notification of pit-stops

Pit-stops are basically an opportunity for businesses along the Wild Atlantic Way to benefit from this app's services. A business can apply for their business to be advertised as a pit-stop on the Wild Atlantic Way. When a user is cycling a route they will be unobtrusively notified of a pit-stop coming up.

#### Finding a route by popularity

The app will find a list of the most popular routes within a distance of 100 kilometres of the device location.

#### Creating and saving a route

Users can create a new route which (if chosen to be saved) will be published to and available for other cyclists to undertake. A set of results are also tracked and saved, with running statistical feedback available alongside a Google Map display tracking and following the user's path.

#### Viewing previously saved results/routes

Previously saved routes and results can be retrieved and viewed by the user.
